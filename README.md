# Dockerizing and Deploying a Web Application

This project involves two simple Node.js applications, which were Dockerized and deployed on Azure. Each application is containerized for easy scaling and deployment, allowing seamless setup on cloud infrastructure.

## Steps
1. Created two Node.js applications with minimal functionality.
2. Dockerized each application using Dockerfiles for consistent environments.
3. Deployed the containers on Azure, to explore the approaches used for accessibility and scalability.

This setup provides a straightforward example of containerized web application deployment on a cloud platform.
